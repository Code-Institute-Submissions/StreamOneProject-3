<h1>Timeline Events of the Pencil</h1>

<div class="timeline">

<div class="cont left"><h2>1300BC</h2><p>During Roman times, people used a thin pointed metal rod called a stylus to write with. They wrote on a soft wax tablet using the sharp end. To use the tablet again, or rub out a mistake you smoothed the wax over with the blunt end. For important letters the Romans used a metal pen dipped in ink, which were wrote on thin pieces of wood or on specially prepared animal skins.</p>

<div class="cont left"><h2>1812</h2><p>Willam Munroe manufatured the first American lead pencils in 1812. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only the help of his wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports.</p>
