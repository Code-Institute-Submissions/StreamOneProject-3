# Stream One Project - **Straight to the Point**

## About
I chose to create my own project using the subject of the **Pencil**.

I tried to take an artistic approach by using my own photography and keep it minimalistic for a simple and clean look.

The Icon was made by myself aswell.

The target audience is artists and people with an interest of this subject.

The website has 5 pages.

To the right of the nav bar is the feeback tab which when clicked takes you feeback page.

The main body in the center has 3 images which I chose to used for taps instead of nav bar tabs for this page.

I felt it would look nicer and be more fun for the user.

I used a mockup tool called Pencil to do a basic design for the website. As time went on I changed things a little and used pen and paper aswell.
